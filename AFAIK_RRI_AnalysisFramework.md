## PHASE 1: PRE-ANALYSIS REFLECTION — BIAS AWARENESS

**Personal & Systemic Bias Audit (Self-Reflexivity)**

Before analyzing the brick, explicitly name potential biases influencing the analysis itself:

- North Americentrism / Eurocentrism
- Gender & Sexuality Bias
- Class & Economic Assumptions
- Ableism & Neurodiversity Invisibility
- Racialization & Settler-Colonial Perspectives
- Epistemic Bias (privileging certain knowledge systems)
- Ability/Disability Normalization
- Age & Generational Biases
- Religious/Secular Assumption

**Instruction:** For each relevant bias category identified in your field (Phase 0), write 2–3 sentences naming how it *might* affect your reading of the content. Be specific and honest.

---

## PHASE 2: CONTENT CAPTURE

### 2A. Explicit Content
**What is directly taught?**
- Main claims, definitions, frameworks, theories
- Historical/factual information presented
- Examples, case studies, illustrations
- Stated learning objectives or takeaways

### 2B. Implicit Assumptions
**What is presupposed or taken for granted?**
- Underlying values, worldviews, ontologies
- Unstated norms (e.g., "normal" family, "standard" development, "rational" actors)
- Who is the imagined audience? Whose experiences are centered?
- What counts as "knowledge" or "evidence"?
- Temporal, spatial, and cultural defaults (e.g., linear time, Western institutions, individualism)

### 2C. Discipline-Specific Observations
**Field-relevant analytical notes:**
- For **Humanities:** Canon assumptions, interpretive authority, whose voices are validated?
- For **Social Sciences:** Positionality of researchers/authors, power dynamics, sampling/representation?
- For **Natural Sciences:** Methods, reproducibility, uncertainty communication, environmental impact?
- For **Technical Sciences:** Supply chains, who benefits/suffers, accessibility, automation bias?
- For **Mathematics:** Axioms stated or hidden? Historical credit? Multiple solution paths shown?
- For **Medicine:** Whose bodies are normative? Biomedical vs. social model? Informed consent?

## PHASE 3: BIAS & GAP ANALYSIS

### 3A. Structured Bias Audit (Finding → Missing → Fix)

| **Bias Category** | **Finding (What is presented)** | **Missing (What is absent/marginalized)** | **Fix (Concrete remedy)** | **Priority** | **Effort** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Name] | Describe manifestation in brick | What populations, perspectives, methods are invisible? | Specific content, example, or approach to add | 1–3 | Low/Med/High |
| [Name] | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Instruction:** Identify 5–8 primary biases. For each, be concrete with examples. Prioritize fixes (1 = critical; 3 = important but secondary). Estimate effort (Low = <10 min; Med = 10–30 min; High = >30 min).

### 3B. Critical Gaps & Questions
**What essential perspectives, methods, or contexts are missing?**
- Geographic / cultural representation?
- Gender / sexuality / disability dimensions?
- Power / structural / institutional analysis?
- Historical / postcolonial / decolonial perspectives?
- Environmental / ecological / temporal dimensions?
- Pluralistic values (justice, rights, dignity, care, relational)?
- Stakeholder voices (those affected by the content)?

### 3C. RRI (Responsible Research & Innovation) Anchoring

Map gaps to RRI principles:

| **RRI Principle** | **Current State** | **Gap** | **Intervention** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open Science** | How transparent are sources, methods, assumptions? | Who decides what counts as "science"? Whose knowledge is validated? | Diversify epistemologies; credit non-Western scholars; make axioms explicit |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Are affected communities consulted in the brick? | Whose voices are heard; whose are silent? | Include perspectives from marginalized, disabled, colonized, nonhuman actors |
| **Sustainability** | Long-term, environmental, intergenerational impacts addressed? | Present-focused? Anthropocentric? | Add environmental, future-generation, nonhuman ethics dimensions |
| **Dual-Use** | Could this content rationalize harm or injustice? | Misuse potential unexamined? | Analyze how frameworks/claims could justify oppression; name guardrails |
| **Epistemic Justice** | Are all knowledge systems treated as equally valid? | Hierarchies invisible (West > East, Science > Indigenous, etc.)? | Reframe alternatives as equals, not exotica; decenter Western canon |

---

## PHASE 4: STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES

### 4A. Strengths
- **Clarity & Accessibility:** Is the brick easy to understand? For whom?
- **Practical Utility:** Does it prepare learners for real-world application?
- **Inclusivity:** Which perspectives/populations are well-represented?
- **Rigor & Evidence:** Is the foundation solid and current?
- **Pedagogical Design:** Are diverse learning styles/abilities supported?

### 4B. Weaknesses
- **Exclusions & Erasures:** Who is missing? What alternatives are unseen?
- **Problematic Assumptions:** What normative claims are presented as universal?
- **Risk of Misuse:** Could this reinforce stereotypes, justify oppression, or harm vulnerable groups?
- **Outdated/Incomplete Evidence:** Are contemporary critiques, intersectional analyses, or decolonial work missing?
- **Accessibility Barriers:** Language complexity, examples, formats—for whom does this exclude?

---

## PHASE 5: EVIDENCE, SCOPE & TIMELINESS

**Assess the quality and currency of the brick's foundation:**

- **Foundation:** What scholarly/empirical basis exists? Is it cited? Peer-reviewed?
- **Currency:** How recent are sources? Are contemporary critiques, decolonial scholars, intersectional perspectives included?
- **Complexity:** Appropriately pitched for target audience? Over/under-simplified?
- **Depth/Breadth:** Comprehensive coverage of field? Or narrow/canonical?
- **Contextualization:** Is the brick embedded in historical, geographic, cultural, political context? Or presented as "timeless/universal"?
- **Reproducibility/Transferability:** Can findings/claims be verified? Do they apply across contexts or are they locally contingent?

---

## PHASE 6: RECOMMENDATIONS (Prioritized & Actionable)

### 6A. Priority-Ranked Recommendations

| **Priority** | **Action** | **Why** | **Effort** | **Field-Specific How-To** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 (Critical)** | [Remedy highest-severity bias] | [Link to equity/inclusion impact] | Low/Med/High | Concrete example: "Add paragraph on…" or "Create sub-brick on…" |
| **2 (Important)** | [Secondary but significant gap] | [Stakeholder or epistemological impact] | Low/Med/High | [Specific approach] |
| **3 (Enhancement)** | [Nice-to-have refinement] | [Broadens perspective/access] | Low/Med/High | [Specific approach] |

### 6B. Field-Specific How-To Examples

**HUMANITIES:**  
"Integrate non-Western ethics (Ubuntu, Confucianism, Islamic) as *equals* to Western analytic tradition, not exotic variants. Reframe as 'Multiple Moral Epistemologies' not 'Western vs. Other.' Credit non-Western philosophers equally; show their internal coherence, not just 'comparison.'"

**SOCIAL SCIENCES:**  
"Add section: 'Whose Positionality?' Reflect on researcher/author identity (race, gender, class, nationality, institutional power). Name positionality; acknowledge blind spots. Include voices from the population studied, not just external analysis."

**NATURAL SCIENCES:**  
"Communicate uncertainty probabilistically, not as fact. Example: Not 'Genes cause X' but 'influence P(X) by Y% under conditions Z.' Explicitly state limits of methods, sample size, confounding factors, reproducibility challenges."

**TECHNICAL SCIENCES:**  
"Analyze lifecycle: Material extraction → Manufacturing → Data collection/processing → Use → Waste/Disposal. For each stage: Who suffers environmental damage? Whose data is harvested? What surveillance happens? Who profits?"

**MATHEMATICS:**  
"Acknowledge axioms explicitly. Credit all mathematicians (Al-Khwarizmi, Emmy Noether, Ramanujan, etc.), not just Euler/Gauss. Show multiple proofs or solution methods. Name historical erasures; invite alternative approaches."

**MEDICINE:**  
"Examine whose bodies are normative. Add: social determinants of health, accessibility/disability justice, informed consent challenges, environmental health impacts. Name pharma colonialism; include non-biomedical healing traditions."

## NOTES FOR ANALYSTS

1. **Be Specific, Not Generic:** Every statement should reference the actual brick content, not abstract principles. Use direct quotes when possible.

2. **Concrete Examples:** For every bias or gap, provide a concrete example from the brick or propose a specific fix, not vague suggestions.

3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** Not all gaps are equally important. Equity-harming biases (e.g., perpetuating stereotypes, erasing marginalized knowledge) rank highest.

4. **Fair Balance:** Criticize with evidence and nuance. Acknowledge genuine strengths; don't dismiss entire bricks as "bad." Show appreciation for what works, then show where it can improve.

5. **Realistic Effort Estimates:** Be honest. Adding diverse perspectives ≠ surface edits. Structural changes take time.

6. **Invite Collaboration:** Analysis should suggest who should be consulted (scholars from marginalized fields, affected communities, etc.) to make improvements authentic, not extractive.
