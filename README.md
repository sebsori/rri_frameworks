## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive frameworks for evaluating educational content through the lens of **Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)** principles. The frameworks emphasize critical analysis of bias, assumptions, power dynamics, and social responsibility across educational materials.

Included are:

1. **Universal 7-Phase RRI-Enhanced Analysis Framework** – A versatile evaluation tool applicable to any educational content (lectures, textbooks, online courses, etc.)
2. **Genetics-Specific RRI-Enhanced Framework** – A domain-specialized adaptation addressing unique epistemic, ethical, and social challenges in genomics and genetics education

Both frameworks prioritize:
- **Bias identification** (including domain-specific biases)
- **Stakeholder engagement** and marginalized perspectives
- **Sustainability** and long-term social/environmental impact
- **Dual-use risk awareness** (for applicable domains)
- **Open Science principles**
- **Public engagement** and societal responsibility

## Genetics Framework: Specific Bias Categories Addressed

The genetics-specific framework includes targeted audits for seven critical biases:

| Bias Type | Definition | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Genetic Essentialism** | Genes viewed as deterministic and immutable | Increases racial prejudice, fatalism about traits |
| **Genetic Determinism** | Overemphasis on genetics vs. environment | Oversimplifies complex trait etiology |
| **Racialization** | Race treated as biological category | Perpetuates pseudoscientific racism |
| **Medicalization** | Variation framed as pathology | Stigmatizes difference; pathologizes neurodiversity |
| **Reductionism** | Complex traits reduced to single genes | Creates false deterministic models |
| **Technological Solutionism** | Genetic engineering as panacea | Ignores social/environmental solutions |
| **Western Genomic Bias** | European ancestry dominance in data | Limits precision medicine for non-European populations |

---

## Quality Scoring: Genetics Education

### Scoring Matrix (0-5 per dimension, weighted)

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Technical Excellence | 1x | Accuracy, currency, appropriate complexity |
| **Counters Genetic Essentialism** | **2x** | *PRIMARY criterion* – probabilistic framing, environmental integration |
| Ethical Depth | 1.5x | Dual-use analysis, autonomy respect, justice orientation |
| Social Justice & Inclusion | 1.5x | Access equity, stakeholder voices, historical context |
| Environmental Responsibility | 1x | GMO sustainability, gene drive ecology, climate implications |
| Stakeholder Engagement | 1x | Community involvement, diverse perspectives |
| Public Literacy Support | 1x | Misconception correction, accessibility, democratic participation |

**Interpretation:**
- **0-15:** Inadequate (major RRI gaps, essentialism risks high)
- **16-28:** Developing (some RRI elements, needs strengthening)
- **29-37:** Proficient (solid RRI integration, minor gaps)
- **38-42.5:** Exemplary (comprehensive RRI approach, counters essentialism)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use these frameworks for educational content outside genetics?**  
A: Yes! The universal `rri_7_phase_analysis_enhanced.md` framework applies to any educational content. The genetics-specific framework is specialized, but you can adapt it to create domain-specific versions for other fields.

**Q: How long does evaluation typically take?**  
A: Quick audit (Five-Phase Priority for genetics): 2-4 hours. Comprehensive evaluation (all 10 phases + multidisciplinary team): 1-2 weeks. Depends on content volume and team size.

**Q: Do I need to use all 10 phases?**  
A: No. The frameworks are modular and scalable. Use phases appropriate to your context and needs. Quick audits may use only phases 1-3 and 7.

**Q: How do I handle controversial topics (e.g., germline editing, genetic enhancement)?**  
A: Use Phase 6 (Competing Hypotheses analysis) and Phase 7 (Critical Discourse Analysis). Framework explicitly engages multiple ethical perspectives rather than imposing single viewpoint.

**Q: Can these frameworks be used for student evaluation?**  
A: Yes, adapted. Use frameworks to evaluate student work for bias awareness, stakeholder engagement, RRI principles. Could develop learning objectives aligned with framework dimensions.

**Q: How often should curricula be re-evaluated?**  
A: Recommendation: Annual review for genetics/genomics education (field evolves rapidly). Whenever new major developments occur (new CRISPR applications, policy changes, equity concerns emerge).
