# COMPREHENSIVE 7-PHASE (RRI-ENHANCED) ANALYSIS PROMPT FOR LEARNING UNITS ("BRICKS")
## Universal Application Format for All Educational Content

---

## CONTEXT & METACOGNITIVE PREPARATION

Analyze a learning unit ("Brick") consisting of slides, flowing text, and reflection questions.

### Reflection BEFORE Analysis (Bias-Awareness & RRI Orientation):
- Which biases could influence your analysis? (Confirmation bias, stereotypes, cultural assumptions, epistemic bias)
- Which implicit assumptions do you bring to this analysis? (disciplinary, institutional, socio-cultural)
- How can you minimize these biases?
- **Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI):** Which principles of Open Science, societal responsibility, sustainability, public engagement, or responsiveness could/should shape this analysis?

Conduct this reflection BEFORE beginning content analysis.

---

## PHASES 1–2: UNDERSTANDING & PRELIMINARY JUDGMENT

**Slide Level:**
- Main messages (bullet points)
- Structure and logical flow
- Explicitly named concepts

**Flowing Text Level:**
- Core ideas and connections
- Definitions & cited sources
- Scope/depth (superficial vs. comprehensive)

**Questions Level:**
- Question types (comprehension, critique, synthesis)
- Coverage & difficulty

**Tentative assessment:**
- Initial strengths/weaknesses/noteworthy features

---

## PHASE 3: CRITICAL EVALUATION WITH BIAS & RESPONSIBILITY CHECKS

### Bias-Checks:
- **Gender**
- **Culture/Ethnicity**
- **Socioeconomic status**
- **Medicalization/Ableism**
- **Age, LGBTQIA+, Religion, Linguistic, Epistemic**
- **Intersectionality**: Are multiple, overlapping identity dimensions considered?

### Assumptions-Check:
- Core, disciplinary, and ethical assumptions
- Alternative perspectives

### RRI-Responsibility-Check:
- Does the unit encourage openness, societal engagement, sustainability, or responsiveness?
- Are stakeholders and affected communities visible/involved?
- Are long-term ecological/social impacts and dual-use risks considered?

### Devil’s Advocacy & Disconfirming Evidence Search
- Strong counterarguments
- Alternative interpretations
- Unaddressed limitations

---

## PHASE 4: FINAL DECISION, CONTENT DIMENSIONS (RRI-Expanded)

### Dimension 1: Content & Structure
- Explicit/implicit content
- Organization & coherence

### Dimension 2: Context & Target Audience
- Intended audience, prior knowledge, accessibility, inclusion
- Societal/ethical context: relevance, public interest

### Dimension 3: Completeness & Gaps
- Missing perspectives (e.g. marginalized/vulnerable groups)
- Relevance for sustainability & social responsibility

### Dimension 4: Framing
- Lexical choice & value judgements
- Alternatives & diversity of frameworks
- Privileged/marginalized groups

### Dimension 5: Implicit Assumptions
- About normality, disorder, difference, expertise
- Western/epistemic/disciplinary biases

---

## PHASE 5: CONFIDENCE & UNCERTAINTY
- Confidence rating/justification
- Sources of uncertainty
- Needs for further input/expertise

---

## PHASE 6: STRUCTURED ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES (SATs)
- Key assumptions check
- Competing hypotheses (if controversial)
- What-if analysis (counterfactuals incl. public engagement, Open Science, inclusion)
- Red Team analysis (strongest RRI-based criticisms)

---

## PHASE 7: CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS & SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY

### CDA-Level 1: Textual
- Lexical choices, modalities, framing

### CDA-Level 2: Discursive Practices
- Authority, authorship, exclusion/inclusion
- Public engagement & openness
- Stakeholder diversity

### CDA-Level 3: Social Practices
- Power structures (served/ignored)
- Societal responsibility, sustainability, impact
- Historical context & institutional logics

---

## PHASE 8: RRI-BASED SYNTHESIS & MULTI-PERSPECTIVE OVERVIEW
- Integrate perspectives (Critical Educator, Subject Expert, Diversity Consultant, Learner, Red Team, plus Stakeholder/Public Persona)
- Consensus/divergence; strongest arguments in terms of responsibility & impact

---

## PHASE 9: VALIDATION THROUGH TRIANGULATION & DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE
- Cross-check findings between approaches & perspectives
- Explicit search for counter-evidence (
 inclusion, societal impact, Open Science)

---

## PHASE 10: FINAL SYNTHESIS, RECOMMENDATIONS & OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### Executive Summary
- Core findings with confidence levels

### Dimension Analysis
- Detailed narrative, evidence, and uncertainty rating

### Multi-Perspective/Stakeholder Table
- Summary of consensus/divergence by dimension

### CDA Report
- Power, responsibility, inclusion, social impact

### Controversial/Unresolved Points (esp. societal/ethical)

### SATs Overview
- Key assumptions, what-ifs, red team critiques

### Limitations & Uncertainties

### Recommendations (Prioritized, incl. RRI/social responsibility)
- RRI-relevant enhancements

### Overall Quality & Societal Meaningfulness

---

## PROMPT CUSTOMIZATION & VARIATIONS (RRI-ORIENTED)
- Strengthen for RRI, inclusion, participatory evaluation as required
- Adapt to context (education, research, public outreach)
- Enable iterative improvement via stakeholder feedback

---

## USAGE NOTES
- Modular, universally applicable, scalable for depth & context
- Explicitly focus on societal responsibility, stakeholder diversity, Open Science, sustainability & inclusion based on needs
