## CONTEXT & METACOGNITIVE PREPARATION (GENETICS-ADAPTED)

### Reflection BEFORE Analysis:

**Standard RRI Biases:**
- Confirmation bias, cultural assumptions, epistemic bias

**Genetics-Specific Biases to Address:**
- **Genetic Essentialism:** Tendency to view genes as deterministic and immutable
- **Genetic Determinism:** Overemphasis on genetic causation vs. gene-environment interaction
- **Racialization Bias:** Using race as biological category rather than social construct
- **Medicalization Bias:** Framing genetic variation as pathology vs. diversity
- **Reductionism:** Oversimplifying complex traits to single-gene models
- **Technological Solutionism:** Assuming genetic engineering can solve all problems
- **Western Genomic Bias:** Privileging European ancestry in genomic databases

**RRI Principles for Genetics:**
- Open Science & data diversity (ancestral representation in databases)
- Public Genetic Literacy (avoiding essentialism in communication)
- Sustainability (environmental impact of GMOs, agricultural genetics)
- Dual-Use Awareness (biosecurity, bioweapons, misuse potential)
- Justice & Access (genetic healthcare inequality, "genetic underclass" risks)
- Stakeholder Engagement (affected communities, patient groups, indigenous peoples)
